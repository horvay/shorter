## Project Overview
This is a project used to download videos from youtube and then create shorts or clips from the video. It'll have the ability to create either a short format or a normal video format.

Features:
- Download a video from youtube given a URL
- The ability to select a start and end section of the video with a preview of what is being selected
- The ability to remove sections of the video automatically where there is up to 1 second of silence.
- Once narrowed down, the ability to select small chunks and remove them

## Code Style and Standards
- Prefer functional over OOP and classes
- Should use Python
- Should provide types where possible

## Documentation Requirements
- All video manipulation should use ffmpeg - assume it exists in the path
- Moviepy should NOT be used, as it is very slow
- When creating a vertical short from a normal video, it should put the video 1/3rd up the vertical video
- Each step should have it's own tab or screen (download, select a section of video and cutting out the rest, remove quiet sections over 1 second, ability to remove chunks)

## Environment and Configuration
- Should work on both Linux and Windows
